  abstract = {This work addresses the challenge “how do we make better security decisions?” and it develops techniques to support human decision making and algorithms which enable well-founded cyber security decisions to be made. In this paper we propose a game theoretic model which optimally allocates cyber security resources such as administrators' time across different tasks. We first model the interactions between an omnipresent attacker and a team of system administrators seen as the defender, and we have derived the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) in such games. We have formulated general-sum games that represent our cyber security environment, and we have proven that the defender's Nash strategy is also minimax. This result guarantees that independently from the attacker's strategy the defender's solution is optimal. We also propose Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an efficient technique to compute approximate equilibria in our games. By implementing and evaluating a minimax solver with SVD, we have thoroughly investigated the improvement that Nash defense introduces compared to other strategies chosen by common sense decision algorithms. Our key finding is that a particular NE, which we call weighted NE, provides the most effective defense strategy. In order to validate this model we have used real-life statistics from Hackmageddon, the Verizon 2013 Data Breach Investigation report, and the Ponemon report of 2011. We finally compare the game theoretic defense method with a method which implements a stochastic optimization algorithm.},

  abstract = {As the number of data breaches in the United States grows each year, cyber-security has become an increasingly important policy area. The primary mechanism for regulating and deterring data breaches is the "data breach notification law." Every U.S. state now has such a law that mandates that certain organizations disclose data breaches to their data subjects. Despite the popularity of these laws, there is relatively little evidence about their effectiveness at deterring breaches, and therefore reducing identity theft. Using medical identity theft panel data collected from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), this study implements an augmented synthetic control approach to analyze the effect of certain data breach notification standards on medical identity theft.},

  abstract = {Recognized as one of the most cited methodology books in the social sciences, the Sixth Edition of Robert K. Yin′s bestselling text provides a complete portal to the world of case study research. With the integration of 11 applications in this edition, the book gives readers access to exemplary case studies drawn from a wide variety of academic and applied fields. Ultimately, Case Study Research and Applications will guide students in the successful design and use of the case study research method.   New to this Edition  Includes 11 in depth applications that show how researchers have implemented case study methods successfully. Increases reference to relativist and constructivist approaches to case study research, as well as how case studies can be part of mixed methods projects. Places greater emphasis on using plausible rival explanations to bolster case study quality. Discusses synthesizing findings across case studies in a multiple case study in more detail Adds an expanded list of 15 fields that have text or texts devoted to case study research.  Sharpens discussion of distinguishing research from non research case studies.  The author brings to light at least three remaining gaps to be filled in the future: how rival explanations can become more routinely integrated into all case study research;  the difference between case based and variable based approaches to designing and analyzing case studies; and  the relationship between case study research and qualitative research.},
